This is collections of Portfolios I have done.
Some references are about summaries when I studied materials. These include not only contents but also my own intuitions.
I did it to understand formula better and practice these methods.

Other is about some mini-project I did. Many of them are about solving problems in the real world using mathematical modeling.
But some of them also use computer science knowledge.
