    <h1>Welcome to Jeongwoon Kim's homepage</h1>
    Hello, My name is Jeongwoon Kim and I'm currently master student in Postech<br>
    This webpage is to store my portfolio, which includes not only mini-project but also summaries for some materials I read.<br>
    These summaries are about my intuitions at some mathematical formula, which I think is hard to get by oneself.<br>
    And some materials are not translated into english, so if you want to read immediately email to me.<br>
    Then, I will translate them using DeepL and review them before sending.<br>
