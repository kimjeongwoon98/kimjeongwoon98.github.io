        <h2>Brain network modeling</h2>
        <p>Brain is a complex system that people can't understand fully and making model for it is still challenging.<br>
          The relations between voxels cannot be determined because of effects from other voxels. Also, it is hard to calculate it without dimension reduction.<br>
          Many reduction algorithms assume indepdence of input which is not true in brain. To overcome this, some people modify algorithms based on GLS regression.<br>
          But we can't apply this directly due to huge number of voxels, so we need to reduce size of matrix like clustering. However, there are some problem with it because we can't consider global relations if we use clustering.<br>
          So, my research interest is how to reduce data size more efficiently considering heterogenity of voxels</p>

        <h2>Evolution dynamics for Psychology</h2>
        <p>There are many phenomenon which current evolution psychology can't explain easily. Paraphilic disorders, especially Pedophilic disorder is one example of it.
           it is well known that living organisms prefer to one having some traits contributing to survival and birth.<br>
           However, Pedoplilia violates these assumption but there are no clear theory to explain it.
           But some people estimate 1-5% of people are pedophilic, which is not small rate in medical science.<br>
           So I have a plan to make model for why some people suffer Pedophilia and this research may contribute to preventing children from sexual criminial.</p>

        <h2>Network modelling for Criminal</h2>
        <p>It is not easy to detect criminals. Some research even claims that the number of case for criminal is actully 10 times more than statstics announced by police<br>
            So it is important to make model for criminal considering concealment of it, because it can be used for setting effective policy to prevent criminals.<br>
            But many research focus on the psychological state and life history of perpetrators and social environment.<br>
            These are also important but they have limitation because they focus on group not individuals, which makes hard for us to predict the proability of criminals<br>
            Also collecting information of them is challenging<br>
            To overcome these limitation, I will do model the criminials action by network model considering the unobserved state if I decide these fields.
